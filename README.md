SNHU CS-370 Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science


## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In Project Two, I was tasked with completing a program for an intelligent agent in a treasure hunt game by implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm. Additionally, I was required to provide a defense to my chosen design once it was complete. The code that was provided included multiple files for the game environment, the pirate agent, and the initial structure for the Q-learning algorithm. The code that I created defined the final structure for this algorithm and determined how the agent would handle each episode, epoch, and actions in between, as well as how it would determine when it's training was complete.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are incredibly important in today's world as so many facets of our reality are affected by or dependent on computer systems. Computer scientists are widely diverse in their skill sets and are responsible for the existence of many of the necessities and conveniences that we use on a daily basis. Nearly every electronic device in existence today has some sort of programming built into it and likely required the expertise of many different computer scientists to be created. In addition, computer scientists are a key part of creating the technology that many businesses are founded upon.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My aim as a computer scientist is to create solutions through code that are effective and efficient. With this goal in mind, my approach begins with the discovery of project constraints and requirements. In addition, breaking problems into smaller, incremental pieces allows me to make small changes to code, checking for bugs along the way. All of this adds up to a methodical, iterative approach which allows me to obtain a thorough understanding of the problem so that I can develop a deeply successful solution.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities are far reaching, diverse, and often depend upon the project. In regard to the end user, my ethical responsilities often include protecting user data against unauthorized access and misuse. In addition, usability and accessibility are facets that must also be considered, especially in regard to users with disabilities. Furthermore, creating transparent and unbiased software is crucial to ensure that certain groups are not discriminated against and that all users are able to understand how their data is being used.

My ethical responsibilities in regard to the organization include integrity and honesty throughout my professional interactions. This includes communicating with transparency and not withholding details about progress or limitations. Additionally, it is my duty to protect the organization's sensitive data and intellectual property.
